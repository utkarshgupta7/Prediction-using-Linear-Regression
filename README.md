# Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
In this Project, I have run a multiple linear regression to determine the Price of houses. Divide the data into test and train where the training set is 75% of the data.  Using the variables- "Rooms", "Price", "Bedroom2", "Bathroom","Landsize", "BuildingArea", "YearBuilt". Created age of housing variable.  Normalizing the variables.
